pixelator - a CODAP data plugin

## What is it?

A simple tool to read and process digital image data

## Why did you make this?

I (Anna Fergusson) developed this plugin as part of my PhD research, to support learners to engage with digital image data within the context of reasoning with numeric distributions.

## It's not working or freezing or some other issue?
